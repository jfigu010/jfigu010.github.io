							10/20/2016<br>
							
								My time at ISCA Technolgoies, Inc has been one of the greatest in my life. I have learned so much since I started as an intern and I've been able to put 
								on practice the concepts and theories I have learned in school. My journey started as an intern at the end of the Summer 2015. Working part time at the company, 
								I was typical intern that had little bit idea of the fast-paced environment that working in a company demands. <br>

								The first weeks/months I was able to learn the ropes as quickly as I could in order to be as helpful as I could every morning I was able to work. 
								With the help of the chemist and my awesome supervisor I was able to understand not only what I was doing in the laboratory but how this impacted the company. 
								I worked mainly on Quality Control and Research and Development as an intern. The studies we hosted and the products we were validating to sell were a main component 
								of the grow that ISCA was having all year 2015. <br>

								<div style="text-align: center;" style="height:50%"><IMG HEIGHT="100%" WIDTH="100%" SRC="images/wasteWaterFacility.JPG" ALT="image"><br><b></b></div><br>
								After my graduation I was able to continue working at the company now full-time as an Analytical Chemist. My work since there has expanded to product development 
								now having the cycle of the creation of the product as a skillset. Being able to participate in all aspects of the product starting with creating a product by 
								Research and Development, EPA registration, product development and Quality Control felt awesome. It open my eyes to my potential in the company. 
								Later as an assignment I was able to help the company save money by fixing an used UV-Spectrophometer which we had bought for cheap with the hope to save money. 
								In no time, I had research the schematic and process of how the equipment worked, planned, tested, and executed a clean up of the system.
								All these I had to do it on my own time, but in less than two weeks I was able to have the equpiment run smoothly for the purpose we wanted. <br>
								
								I am happy with my job, and professional career that I am starting at ISCA. I can not wait to find out what this path holds for me in the future. <br></div>
