							<h1>About me</h1>
			<p>
				I am a fourth year Chemical engineering student at the University of California, Riverside. My field of study is in Chemistry.<br>
				I am interested on finding an internship and job in one of the following industries: Manufacturing, Design and Construction, petrochemicals, and food processing.
			</p>
			<p>
				The idea of creating a website started when I wanted to learn more about coding!<br>
				I thought it would be great to show and highlight my engineering and leadership skills.<br>
				Here I will be showing my professional and academic work, community outreach involvement and personal hobbies/interest.
			</p>

				Hello everyone! Here are some updates of my fourth year. I had the opportunity to lead the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers chapter at UCR.<br>
				It was a great experience to be part of such organization and to have worked with my executive board. Together we accomplishied many of the goals that we had set for the year.<br>
				I will be posting some pictures that will highlight events and conferences that I was part during the year. <br>
				<br>
				Also I had my Senior Design project. Me as well as four other colleagues worked on upgrading a waste water treatment facility which is located in the Autonomous University of Baja California (UABC) in Tijuana, Mexico.<br>
				The need for the university to upgrade was to use the effluent treated water for irrigation. Currently the effluent does not meet the mexican daily standards for nitrate concentration.<br>
				It was a great project in which I had the opportunity to attend and visit the campus as well as collaborate with the mexican counterparts in the project.<br>
				<br>
				The current design of the project consisted on a pre-treatment screen, a biological reactor, a clarifier and a storage building.<br>
				The tertiary design that we proposed to be the best option consisted on adding sand filters (2) before and after a constructed wetland that will help reduce the nitrates and phosphates concentration for the effluent of the water<br>
				as well as a UV Disinfection system that will complete the disinfection to use the water for irrigation purposes.
